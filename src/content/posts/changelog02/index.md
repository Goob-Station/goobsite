### AKA, I'm outta here losers
When I first joined Goobstation, it was known as the “funny unserious LRP server” where players were encouraged to have fun within the bounds of the rules. I was excited to be a part of that and aimed to make the game enjoyable for everyone. However, the server has since shifted in a different direction. While this change isn’t inherently bad, it’s not the path I initially signed up for, and it’s not one I want to continue down.

This decision has been a long time coming, as I’ve noticed the culture changing over the past few months. It is what it is. I wish most of you the best of luck moving forward.
#### One love, Durk.

## Ghostbar - Durk
I finally got off my ass and added ghostbar, after dying you can choose to respawn here as a random job and do whatever you want inside, (still within the rules of course.)

## Chrono Legionnaire - BombasterDS
Chrono Legionnaire are an admin only 'antag.' They are similar to terminators, and are designed to remove players with real life people/characters as their IC names. They have a bunch of fun tools and gadgets like the timeline disruptor, stasis gun, stasizium injectors, sonic screwdriver, and a bunch of cool armor. 

## Paradise Nanotrasen Representative - Durk

Glue and lube grenades have been added to the mime and clown's uplinks respectively. Go forth and doom sec to a slippery death.

## "Throngler" added to grand lottery. - Scruq445
A foam throngler was added to the grand lottery, it has the same stats as the normal throngler, but doesnt do any damage.

## Advanced Combat Medipens - a-person5660
Combat medipens have been made cheaper, and advanced combat medipens are now in the uplink as a better alternative to them.

## Action Bars Readded - yglop
Ever since changelings were added, its become frustrating to use the action bar when half the time the actions go off your screen, so action bar pages have been readded.
