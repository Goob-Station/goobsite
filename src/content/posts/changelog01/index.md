- We hit 1,000 people in our Discord, and 12,000 unique players on the server
####- A lot of content was added!

::github{repo="Goob-Station/Goob-Station"}
### We are always open to new contributions. Do you have something silly you want added to GS14? Make a pull request!

## Supermatter Engine - VMSoldius & whateverusername0
![SuperMatter](./supermatter.png)

Supermatter is a powerful generator from SS13, originally taken from Whitedream, it's been reworked further by both VMSoldius and whateverusername0. It produces radiation and electrical arcs, and requires active cooling less it delaminates. We recommend reading the guidebook entry to learn more.

## Changelings - whateverusername0
![Changelings](./changelings.png)

Changelings have been added to the game and while they’re still in an initial playtesting stage, they’re a ton of fun to play around with. Changelings have all kinds of abilities ([see here](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/30094)) but the main idea of Changelings is that they are meant to kill and absorb the station’s inhabitants using the plethora of abilities they can unlock.

## Space Wind + Frictionless Space - VMSoldius
![SpaceWind](./spacewind.mp4)

VMSoldius used his massive physics nerd brain to refactor space wind completely, it now behaves properly according to the atmospherics instead of randomly tossing shit around. Along with this we’ve also ported frictionless space to make it extra deadly.

## Resprite from Einstein Engines - FoxxoTrystan & VMSoldius
![Resprite](./retex.png) ![Vendors](./vendors.gif)

All sprites from EE have been ported over to Goobstation, this helps us along quite a bit with our plan to change all sprites to their Paradisestation counterparts.

## Survival Box Rework - Durk & gtheglorius
![SurvivalBoxRework](./survivalbox.png)

The survival box has been effectively useless since the new inventory system was released. When a player takes a single item out of it, it becomes garbage that takes up too much space. This reworks the survival box to a slot-based system, and takes up a 2x2 space instead of 3x3, meaning it stays useful for much longer.

## All-new Lobby Art! (and music) - Piras314, Durk, ka2220, Icepick, & PubliclyExecutedPig
![LobbyArt](./lobbyart.png)

All of the lobby art and music (except space asshole) have been replaced! Many of the lobby screens were made specifically for Goob!

## Durathread Armour - a-person5660 & Piras314
![DurathreadArmour](./durathreadarmour.mp4)

Dura-thread Armour has been added to the game, it’s able to be produced via emagged uniform printer and is similar to a syndicate web-vest statistics-wise, albeit slightly worse. There are 3 dura-thread armours: Dura-thread Armour, Dura-thread Jump-suit, and Dura-thread Web Vest.

## Uplink Price Rework - Piras314, Durk, & TooSillyFennec
All telecrystal values have been multiplied by 5 and almost all values have been rebalanced to encourage and discourage the use of different items, mainly based on what’s bought too often and what you rarely see, trying to diversify syndicate strategy. This allows us to have a lot more flexibility when balancing or adding syndicate / uplink items in the future as well.

## SMES Buff - Piras314
SMES have been buffed to be twice as good as before in every way. This makes it so that Engineers have a reasonable amount of time to set up power without it ever going out, as before it was extraordinarily rare that Engineers would be able to set up power fast enough that the power wouldn’t be out for 5-10 minutes, which would simply be unfun for the entire station crew, even the Engineers.

## Rebalanced Pipestacking - Ilya246 & BasedUser
Pipestacking has been reintroduced in a limited fashion. Devices can be anchored over pipes again, and pipes can exist within the same tile as long as they have different flow directions.

## Revert Pressure Damage - Piras314
Space is supposed to be scary and deadly. We reverted the pressure damage changes that allowed players to spacewalk without a suit, and outheal it by sleeping in a bed.

## Automated Goob Changelog - Piras314
Goob finally has a changelog in-game thanks to Piras.
